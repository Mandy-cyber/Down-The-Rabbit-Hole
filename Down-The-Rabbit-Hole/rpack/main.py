#TODO make this into its own package, that will also be used in the website

'''
THE PLAN
---------------------
- function takes user input as variable
- input = a word, phrase or really anything that can be searched
- function randomly selects site from preapproved list to scrape
- get first two paragraphs or maybe 200 words?
- run it through a loop so every x amount of words, it inserts a new line
- randomly choose a word from the new paragraph 
- return both the new word and the 2 paragraphs
